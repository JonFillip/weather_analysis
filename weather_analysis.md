# Weather Analysis, 2010 - 2020
The weather visualization project is aimed at visualizing key
weather parameters e.g temperature, precipitation, soil temperature and weather
types over the time span of a decade (2010-01-01 - 2020-01-28) across various
cities in the United States using Matplotlib and Plotly. The data set is derived from
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather stations (NOAA) Global
Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset.
    
Global Historical Climate Network includes daily land surface observations from 
around the world. The GHCN-Daily was developed to meet the needs of climate analysis 
and monitoring studies that require data at a sub-monthly time resolution 
(e.g., assessments of the frequency of heavy rainfall, heat wave duration, etc.). 
The dataset includes observations from World Meteorological Organization, 
Cooperative, and CoCoRaHS networks. If observed, the station dataset includes max 
and minimum temperatures, total precipitation, snowfall, and depth of snow on ground.
 Some U.S. station data are typically delayed only 24 hours.
